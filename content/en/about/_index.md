Hello my friend, welcome to my blog. My name is Guan Qirui. I graduated from College of Optical Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, and am engaged in the optical design of LiDAR now.I love Optics, Computer Science and Graphic Design. To infinityâ€¦ and beyond!

My blog is generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the theme of [MemE](https://github.com/reuixiy/hugo-theme-meme). The source code is stored in the [GitHub](https://github.com/guanqr/blog) repository. [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) is enable in my blog. Adding it to the main screen of your mobile phone or computer desktop so that you can read my articles anywhere. If you want to subscribe to my blog, <a href="/atom.xml" target="_blank">Atom</a> / <a href="/rss.xml" target="_blank">RSS</a> is recommended.

Unfortunately, the posts on my blog are written in Chinese. This is because, on the one hand, most of the posts are for Chinese readers and myself. On the other hand, I do not have enough time to run a blog with multi-language. Sorry for the inconvenience.

If you find any problems while reading my articles, you are welcome to create new issues or fork and create new pull requests in the repository of my blog's source code on GitHub. If you have any questions, please contact me by email: guanqirui (at) zju.edu.cn.
